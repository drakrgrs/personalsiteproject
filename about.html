    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Born and Raised in the Black Hills of South Dakota, I have now resided in Honlulu, HI for the past six years. <br> 
        I have worked as a professional photohrapher for the past decade, and am currently studying to become a software engineer. <br> My wife and I are preparing for the arrival of our first child late this fall, <br> and I hope to be employed in web development by the end of the year. <br> Aloha.
