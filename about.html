    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        Born and Raised in the Black Hills of South Dakota, I have now resided
        in Honlulu, HI for the past six years. <br />
        I have worked as a professional photohrapher for the past decade, and am
        currently studying to become a software engineer. <br />
        My wife and I are preparing for the arrival of our first child later
        this fall, <br />
        and I hope to be employed in web development by the end of the year.
        <br />
        Aloha.
